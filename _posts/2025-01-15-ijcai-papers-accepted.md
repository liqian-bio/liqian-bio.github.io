Excited to announce that four of our papers have been accepted to IJCAI 2025, one of the top AI conferences! The papers cover multimodal knowledge retrieval, variational hypergraph networks, graph contrastive learning, and aspect sentiment analysis. Looking forward to presenting our work in Montreal this August.
