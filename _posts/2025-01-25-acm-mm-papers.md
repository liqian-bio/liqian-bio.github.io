Delighted to announce that three papers have been accepted to ACM Multimedia 2025 (ACM MM 2025), a premier conference in multimedia research! The papers cover satellite commonsense reasoning on multimodal knowledge graphs, image fusion with hybrid features, and object-guided monocular depth estimation using diffusion models. These works demonstrate advances in multimodal AI and computer vision. Looking forward to presenting at the conference!
