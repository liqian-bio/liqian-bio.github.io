# 个人简介
bio: |
  I am currently at BUPT working in collaboration with <a href="https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/sgwang/zh_CN/index.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Shangguang Wang</a> (IET Fellow). I received my Ph.D. degree in 2024 from Beihang University (BUAA), my M.S. degree from BUPT in 2019, 
  and my B.S. degree from Central South University (CSU) in 2016. I have published about 30 papers in CCF-A/B papers, including NeurIPS, WWW, IJCAI, ACL, and MM. Google Scholar citations exceed 2,500. 
  
  I won the ESI Highly Cited Papers, Best Paper Nomination at CIKM 2022, the IEEE TCCLD 2024 Technical Innovation Award, and First Prize for Scientific and Technological Progress from the State Grid Big Data Center. 
  I also won the Championship at CodaLab Challenge 2022 and CCKS for two consecutive years.
  
  I currently serve as a Young Editorial Board Member for JAICS and BDIA, Area Chair of NeurIPS 2025 and ACL 2025, and Session Chair of IJCAI 2024.
