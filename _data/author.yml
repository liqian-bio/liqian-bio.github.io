Mentorship Philosophy: |  
  我正在寻找自驱力较强的学生（硕士 2025/2026 年春季和秋季，博士 2026 年春季和秋季）、实习生，与王尚广教授共同指导，目标是在多模态大模型、多模态知识计算、遥感影像解译、多模态卫星计算等课题上做出有影响力的工作。请随时通过电子邮件与我联系。
  I am currently seeking self-motivated students (Master's students for Spring and Fall 2025/2026, and PhD students for Spring and Fall 2026) and interns to co-supervise with Professor Shangguang Wang. Our goal is to conduct impactful research in areas such as multimodal large models, multimodal knowledge computing, remote sensing image interpretation, and multimodal satellite computing. Please feel free to contact me via email at any time.
