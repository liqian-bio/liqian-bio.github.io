I am Qian Li (李倩), currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree (after one year) in the [Beihang University (BUAA)](https://buaa.edu.cn/). I received my B.S. degree from [Central South University (CSU)](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) in 2016, and my M.S. degree from [Beijing University of Posts and Telccommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in 2019.  


During my doctoral studies, my research focused on information extraction and knowledge graph in natural language processing. I have published a total of 18 papers in conferences or journals such as WWW, ACL, IJCAI, AAAI, COLING, CIKM, TASLP, and TNNLS, with 10 of them as the first author. Additionally, I have been granted 8 Chinese patents, with 3 of them as the first inventor by students. I was awarded the first prize of Big Data Center Science and Technology Progress by State Grid Co., LTD. Furthermore, I achieved first place in the international Data competition CodaLab Platform Event Detection Challenge. In addition, I have participated in information extraction related evaluation tasks sponsored by CCKS for two consecutive years and achieved first place and the technology innovation award. If you are interested in discussing or collaborating with me, please feel free to contact me.
