I am Qian Li (李倩), currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree (after one year) in the [Beihang University (BUAA)](https://buaa.edu.cn/). I received my B.S. degree from [Central South University (CSU)](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) in 2016, and my M.S. degree from [Beijing University of Posts and Telccommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in 2019.  

My main research interests include event extraction, information extraction, knowledge graph, multi-modal machine learning. Up to now, I have published several papers (WWW, ACL, CIKM, TASLP, TNNLS, TIST, TWEB, etc.), and won prizes in data competitions. If interested to discuss or work together, please feel free to reach me.
