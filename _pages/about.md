I am Qian Li (李倩), currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/). I received my Ph.D. degree in 2024 from [Beihang University (BUAA)](https://buaa.edu.cn/), my M.S. degree from BUPT in 2019, and my B.S. degree from [Central South University (CSU)](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) in 2016.

My research focused on natural language processing, knowledge graph and multi-modal machine learning. I have published a total of 19 papers in conferences/journals such as WWW, ACL, IJCAI, AAAI, COLING, CIKM, TASLP, and TNNLS, with 10 of them as the first author. Additionally, I have been granted 8 Chinese patents, with 3 of them as the first inventor by students. I was awarded the first prize of Big Data Center Science and Technology Progress by State Grid Co., LTD. Furthermore, I achieved first place in the international Data competition CodaLab Platform Event Detection Challenge. In addition, I have participated in information extraction related evaluation tasks sponsored by CCKS for two consecutive years and achieved first place and the technology innovation award. If you are interested in discussing or collaborating with me, please feel free to contact me.
