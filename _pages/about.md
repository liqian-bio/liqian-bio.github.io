I am currently pursuing a PhD degree (after two years) in the [Beihang University](https://buaa.edu.cn/). I received my Bachelor’s degree from [Central South University (CSU)](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) in 2016, and my Master's degree from [Beijing University of Posts and Telccommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in 2019.  Up to now, I have published several papers in the top conferences and Journal (e.g., WWW, ACL, CIKM, TASLP, TNNLS, TIST, TWEB, etc.), and won prizes in data competitions. 

My main research interests include event extraction, information extraction and knowledge graph.
